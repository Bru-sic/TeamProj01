# Project Proposal
Our project is to perform a health check and expected returns of a portfolio consisting of securities. We will determine the overall portfolioâ€™s performance to date as well as the performance of each individual security in the portfolio. Although aspects of this project are similar to the Module 05 assignment, our point of differentiation is how we intend to structure the data, to use more advanced charting, and problem solve certain aspects desirable to an amateur investor, including portfolio rebalancing recommendations. 

* Our project is to perform a portfolio analysis containing a list of stocks. 
* Our app fetches current and historical data to determine the past performance, current value and future forecasting of a portfolio of securities.
* Nice to have: Our app allows rebalancing of the portfolio based on a target portfolio weighting, suggesting which stocks to buy or sell, and sending the instructions to the trading platform.
* Nice to have: Our app presents a dashboard of comparative performance indicators on the portfolio
* Our app needs stock market data including:
  * Current and historical prices (open, high, low, close)
  * Trading volumes (volume, number of trades, volume-weighted average price (VWAP))
  * Nice to have: Other performance and valuation measure such as Price / Earnings ratios, Price / Book ratios, and Yield. Having Cum/Ex Dividend status and stock split dates will help adjust our analysis for any stock splits
* The kind of questions we will be asking of that data will include:
  * How the portfolio is fairing compared to a benchmark market index (eg S&P500)
  * How has the portfolio performed to date
  * What is the current value of the portfolio
  * What needs to happen to rebalance the portfolio to an ideal target weighting set by the investor 
  * Where could the portfolio be at a future date based on past performance and volatility 
* Possible sources for such data includes Alpaca Markets, NASDAQ, ASX, Binance
